Use `--ignore-marker XXX` to instruct PasDoc to explicitly ignore comments that start with given marker. 

This allows to use "marker" to _reject_ specific comments (in contrast to using link:CommentMarker[--marker] option to _accept_ specific comments).

For example consider this code:

[source,pascal]
----
//~~ Constants ~~
const
  A = 1;
  B = 1;

{~~ Types ~~}
type
  T = T;

// This procedure does something.
//TODO: fix this
procedure DoSomething;
----

You can explicitly reject the unwanted comments above (used as region titles, or TODOs) by using PasDoc with

```
pasdoc --ignore-marker ~~ --ignore-marker TODO ...
```
