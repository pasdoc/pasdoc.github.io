You can use @include link:SupportedTags[tag] to include text from
another file into a description. For example:

[source,pascal]
----
{ This is some procedure.
  @include(some_procedure_large_docs.txt) }
procedure SomeProcedure;
----

Inside file some_procedure_large_docs.txt you can use all normal pasdoc
features, @-tags etc. (see
link:WritingDocumentation[WritingDocumentation]).

The @include tag may be handy when documentation for given item is so
large that it's more comfortable to keep it in entirely separate file.
Or when you want to include some documentation text more than once
--- because you can @include the same file as many times as you wish.

The filename (`some_procedure_large_docs.txt` in the example above) is relative to the Pascal source file defining this identifier (`SomeProcedure` in the example above). You can use something like `@includeCode(../docs/some_procedure_large_docs.txt)` to refer to a different directory.
