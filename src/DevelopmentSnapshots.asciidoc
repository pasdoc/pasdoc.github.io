:doctitle: Development Snapshots

Try the current development version of link:index[PasDoc] by downloading snapshot from here:

https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/releases/tag/snapshot

The files available there are automatically build from the latest source (using https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/tree/master/.github/workflows[GitHub Actions]).

In particular:

* https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/releases/download/snapshot/pasdoc-0.16.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz[latest build for Linux (x86_64)]
* https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/releases/download/snapshot/pasdoc-0.16.0-win64.zip[latest build for Windows (x86_64)]
* https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/releases/download/snapshot/pasdoc-0.16.0-darwin-x86_64.zip[latest build for macOS (x86_64)]
* https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/[latest source code on GitHub]

These snapshots look like regular link:index[PasDoc] releases, but are actually compiled automatically from https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc[current GitHub code].

Don't be confused by their version numbers. As version, they show the
number of last released link:index[PasDoc] version, but in fact they
are just snapshots. When reporting bugs for them, please mention that
you used the snapshots, and mention their date (or Git revision).

Remember that you can always download and compile current pasdoc sources
yourself. See the GIT instructions link:index[on the main page] and
see link:CompilingPasDoc[CompilingPasDoc].
