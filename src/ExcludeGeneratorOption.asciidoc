Pass to pasdoc --exclude-generator option to prevent including in the
output various information about link:index[PasDoc] version.

This includes:

* pasdoc's version,
* compiler name and version used to compile pasdoc, time of compilation.

This information is excluded from every part of pasdoc's output:

* from user-visible parts of documentation (like html pages footer
"Generated by pasdoc")
* from user-invisible parts of documentation
(like html and latex comments)
* from pasdoc's messages printed on
stdout

This option is useful for our automated tests (see pasdoc sources,
tests/ subdirectory). That's because the effect of this option is that
if you generate documentation two times (for the same units, with the
same command-line options) then you will get two times exactly the same
output. Details such as pasdoc version, compiler used to compile pasdoc,
and generation time will _not_ accidentaly make each output of pasdoc
different.
