Things to do related to searching.

* We may add some option like
--use-google-search=URL-WHERE-YOUR-DOCS-ARE to add a search box to your
documentation that just calls Google to search within your docs. It
seems that http://www.google.pl/searchcode.html[Google allows us to do that]. See e.g. how this search works on http://www.mozilla.org/. Of
course, such a thing would _require_ that you put your documentation
online.
* Integration with http://estraier.sourceforge.net/[estraier], open-source server-side search engine.
