# Advanced Features

Summary of the most important non-obvious PasDoc features:

* The documentation can be written in an external files (see the link:ReadDescriptionFromFile[--description] command-line option), not only in the source code.
* The documentation comments in the source code may be in the `interface` or (if you use link:ImplementationCommentsOption[--implementation-comments] option) `implementation` section of the unit.
* The documentation can be localized to many languages, see the link:OutputLanguage[--language] command-line option.
* Support for arbitrary (even optional) link:CommentMarker[comment markers].
* You can write entire pages using pasdoc syntax (like @-tags, see link:WritingDocumentation[WritingDocumentation]). This way you can use pasdoc like a simple document creation tool. See the link:IntroductionAndConclusion[IntroductionAndConclusion] documentation.
* You can easily add a search box to your documentation, just pass link:UseTipueSearchOption[--use-tipue-search] command-line option.
* link:GraphVizSupport[GraphVizSupport] allows PasDoc to easily incorporate classes inheritance and unit dependency graphs in the documentation.
* link:AutoLinkOption[--auto-link] command-line option allows you to avoid writing @link tags, identifiers will be automatically turned into links.
* link:AutoAbstractOption[--auto-abstract] command-line option allows you to automatically treat the 1st sentence of the description as an abstract.
* link:SpellChecking[Spell checking].
* link:CacheOption[Caching for faster generation of documentation].
* link:MarkdownOption[Markdown support for emphasis, lists, code blocks etc.]

If you want to compare link:Home[PasDoc] to FpDoc (another open-source Pascal documentation tool), see link:PasDocFpDocComparison[PasDocFpDocComparison] .
