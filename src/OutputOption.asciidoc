Use link:CommandLine[CommandLine] option --output DIRECTORY (short
form is -E DIRECTORY) to tell PasDoc where to write the output file(s).
By default PasDoc writes output files to the current directory.

Note that the output directory in not created automatically. Make sure
that it exists first. For example, on Unix, use mkdir -p ... like this:

----
mkdir -p doc/
pasdoc --output doc/ MyUnit.pas
----
