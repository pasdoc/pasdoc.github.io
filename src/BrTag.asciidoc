Tag @br forces a line break. E.g. <br> in link:HtmlOutput[HtmlOutput]
or \\ in link:LatexOutput[LatexOutput].

Example:

[source,pascal]
----
{ 1st paragraph. @br Second line of 1st paragraph.

  2nd paragraph. Blah blah blah.

  3rd paragraph. @br
  Second line of 3rd paragraph. }
procedure TestLineBreak;
----

See
http://pasdoc.sourceforge.net/correct_tests_output/html/ok_line_break.html[pasdoc output for this example].

Note that it's not adviced to use this tag too often, since it makes
documentation ugly. In HTML, browser window should determine line width,
in LaTeX, page width should determine line width, and so on. If you want
to start new paragraph you should just insert an empty line (see
link:WritingDocumentation[WritingDocumentation]) in description. It's
possible that in some future output formats @br tag will be ignored (or
equivalent to starting new paragraph) if line break will not be possible
to express in this output format.
