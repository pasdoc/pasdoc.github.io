You can specify the title for the documentation using the --title or -T
directive on the link:Home[PasDoc]
link:CommandLine[CommandLine].

Example:

----
pasdoc --title "The official PasDoc Documentation"
----

The title is used for the HTML <title> tag as well as for a H2 header in
the navigation frame.
