Below I tried to summarize link:index[PasDoc]
(http://pasdoc.sourceforge.net/) and FpDoc
(http://www.freepascal.org/docs-html/fpdoc/fpdoc.html) differences. This
is written by link:MichalisKamburelis[MichalisKamburelis], an author
of link:index[PasDoc] -- but I tried to be as objective as I can.
Feel welcome to edit and improve this page.

* FpDoc keeps descriptions in separate XML files. link:index[PasDoc]
keeps descriptions inside comments in the source interface, or inside
external files (one file for many descriptions, or one file with one
description using @include).
* Formatting in link:index[PasDoc] is
done using @tags (similar to javadoc and such), like
@bold(This is bold text). Formatting in FpDoc is done using XML elements
(similar to HTML), like <b>This is bold text</b>. Both projects support
a lot of formatting options, you can compare the list of @tags on
link:SupportedTags[SupportedTags] with the "Tag reference" on
http://www.freepascal.org/docs-html/fpdoc/fpdoc.html .
* For a list of
supported command-line options and formatting compare
http://www.freepascal.org/docs-html/fpdoc/fpdoc.html with
link:CommandLine[CommandLine] . Both projects support a lot
of options, the differences are in details.
* Some advanced features of
link:index[PasDoc] are listed on
link:AdvancedFeatures[AdvancedFeatures] . Most of them are not available
in fpdoc as far as I know.
* Both programs support many output formats
including HTML and LaTeX.

link:index[PasDoc] has an output called htmlhelp, while fpdoc has chm output, although I didn't compare them personally. link:index[PasDoc] also has link:SimpleXmlOutput[simplexml] output, and latex2rtf output.

You can see sample output of pasdoc e.g. here link:PasDocAutoDoc[PasDocAutoDoc] . Sample fpdoc output is the FPC reference.
* link:index[PasDoc] has a simple cross-platform
GUI (in addition to the command-line of course).
* FpDoc has
http://wiki.freepascal.org/FPDoc_Editor .
* link:index[PasDoc] also
has some useful tools like Pascal preprocessor and file_to_pascal_string
.
* On the other hand, fpdoc is written using fcl-passrc parser, that
can be more easily used by other projects.
