this is one of the link:WantedFeatures[WantedFeatures]

environment variables could optionally be read in addition to command
line parameters.

For example the environment variable INCLUDE could be set instead of
using an --include directive.

link:JohannesBerg[JohannesBerg]: I don't see the reason for this,
what advantage does it have over the command line?

Especially in the case of --include it saves the trouble of specifying a
potentially long (think "c:\program files\delphi 7\projects\common\include")
include path every single time you call link:Home[PasDoc]. Of
course this could be done by specifying --include %INCLUDE% if the
environment variable has been defined. Hm, ok, reduce priority. ;-)
