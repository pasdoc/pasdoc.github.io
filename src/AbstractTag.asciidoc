:doctitle: @abstract tag

For some item types like classes or units you may write very large
descriptions to give an adequate introduction. However, these large
texts are not appropriate in an overview list. Use the abstract tag to
give a short explanation of what an item is about. One row of text is a
good rule of thumb. Of course, there should only be one abstract tag per
description.

Example:

[source,pascal]
----
type
  { @abstract(This class does some very useful thing.)
    With the help of this class you can ...
    (more text that describes how very very
    useful is this class follows). }
  TMyClass = class ...
----

The abstract text will appear in the overview section of the
documentation (if the document format supports this overview section),
and will also appear as the first paragraph of the item full
documentation.

Note that can avoid writing explicit @abstract tag if you use
link:AutoAbstractOption[--auto-abstract command-line option].
