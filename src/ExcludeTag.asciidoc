:doctitle: @exclude tag

link:index[PasDoc] uses the link:SupportedTags[tag] @exclude to
mark items that should not be in the documentation. This can be any type
of item, e.g. a complete class, a method, a field etc.

When @exclude tag is placed at the class/record/interface or unit
comment, then the whole item (whole class, whole unit etc.) with all
it's items will be excluded.

Example:

[source,pascal]
----
type
  { @exclude }
  TSomeHiddenClass = class ... end;

  TSomeVisibleClass = class
  public
    { @exclude }
    procedure SomeHiddenMethod;
  end;
----
