Within link:IntroductionAndConclusion[introduction / conclusion
files] you can use link:SupportedTags[tag] @tableOfContents. This
inserts table of contents at the given place. Table of contents is
automatically constructed by pasdoc, based on the @sections you used.

As a parameter to @tableOfContents tag you can pass an integer value,
this specifies the desired depth of table of contents. E.g.
@tableOfContents(1) tells to show only sections with level 1 in the
table of contents. If you will not give any parameter then the resulting
table of contents will show all the sections that you created in your
introduction or conclusion file.

Table of contents is inserted only in link:HtmlOutput[HtmlOutput]. In
link:LatexOutput[LatexOutput] @tableOfContents tag is simply ignored
because LaTeX documents will always contain full table of contents
anyway (generated by LaTeX tools).

Examples:

* See https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/master/tests/ok_table_of_contents.txt[test introduction file that uses this tag] and the http://pasdoc.sourceforge.net/correct_tests_output/html/ok_table_of_contents/ok_table_of_contents.html[HTML output of this test introduction].
* See also the "Overview" page of link:PasDocAutoDoc[PasDocAutoDoc], @tableOfContents is used there.
