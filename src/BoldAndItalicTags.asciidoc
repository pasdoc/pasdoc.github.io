:doctitle: @bold and @italic tags

Use tag @italic to format given text in __italic__. Use tag @bold to
format given text in **bold**.

These tags may be also enclosed within each other, e.g.

----
@bold(This is bold text. @italic(This is bold and italic text.))
----

It's also allowed (and has no effect on final documentation look) to
enclose these tags within themselves, e.g.

----
@bold(This is bold text. @bold(This is still bold text.))
----

This is simply equivalent to

----
@bold(This is bold text. This is still bold text.)
----

For some output formats that may not support bold / italic font styles,
the intended meaning of @italic is "somehow emphasized text" and @bold
is "more emphasized text".

Don't place paragraph breaks (i.e. empty lines) within @bold / @italic
tags.
