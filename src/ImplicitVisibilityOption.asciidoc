:doctitle: --implicit-visibility command-line option

When you declare a class, ObjectPascal rules say that default ("implicit") visibility of members is __public__, unless the class is declared within {$M+} state or the class inherits from another class
declared in {$M+} state (like TPersistent) -- then it's __published__.

However, pasdoc cannot always absolutely correctly implement this behavior
(only the compiler really knows whether class inherits from another class declared in {$M+} state).

You can control using the command-line option `--implicit-visibility` how
exactly pasdoc handles members with "implicit visibility":

--implicit-visibility=public::
Visibility of implicit members is __public__, unless the class is
declared within {$M+} state, then visibility is __published__. This is
the default setting.

--implicit-visibility=published::
Visibility of implicit members is always __published__.

--implicit-visibility=implicit::
Visibility of implicit members is always __implicit__. _Implicit_ is a new
visibility kind, invented only for the sake of pasdoc. It's another
possible kind for `--visible-members` option. By default,
--visible-members do not include _implicit_ members.

If you don't use `--implicit-visibility=implicit` command-line option then
_no_ members will be ever considered as having an _implicit_ visibility
by pasdoc.
