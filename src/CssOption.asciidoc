:doctitle: --css, --css-based-on-bootstrap command-line options

## Introduction

You can control what your link:HtmlOutput[HTML] and link:HtmlHelp[HtmlHelp]
documentation looks like by tweaking the CSS file.

To use your own style sheet, use the link:CommandLine[CommandLine] option:

- `--css=CSS-FILE` to provide a new CSS file (that does _not_ rely on standard Bootstrap CSS classes, so Bootstrap will not be used in the output).

- `--css-based-on-bootstrap=CSS-FILE` to provide a new CSS file that _does_ rely on standard Bootstrap CSS classes. So Bootstrap will be used in the output.

## Default CSS

The https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/blob/master/source/component/pasdoc.css[default pasdoc.css is here]. Note that it relies on Bootstrap, so if you tweak it, provide the new version using link:Css[--css-based-on-bootstrap] command-line option.

The old `pasdoc.css` that does not rely on Bootstrap is here: https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/blob/master/source/component/alternative_css/pasdoc-up-to-0.16.0.css[source/component/alternative_css/pasdoc-up-to-0.16.0.css]. You can tweak it, and provide the new version using link:Css[--css] command-line option.

## Alternative CSS

We provide some alternative CSS styles in the https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/tree/master/source/component/alternative_css/[source/component/alternative_css/] directory of the PasDoc repository.

Use them directly as a starting point for your own CSS styles.

Examples:

```
pasdoc *.pas -css=source/component/alternative_css/AscanioPressato.css

pasdoc *.pas -css=source/component/alternative_css/ThomasMueller.css

pasdoc *.pas -css=source/component/alternative_css/pasdoc-up-to-0.16.0.css
```
