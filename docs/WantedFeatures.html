          <div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>This page grew into a large collection of wanted features, with wildly varying chances of being actually tackled by a developer.</strong> Although we tried to manage it, it&#8217;s not organized properly enough.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Please report new wanted features to the <a href="https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/issues">GitHub issues</a></strong>, not by editing this page.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>List of wanted features:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Parse TODO items and save them in a table in a separate file similar
to AllVariables.html, AllTypes.html, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support for the ampersand
operator</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The ampersand operator
can be used to distinguish between keywords and identifiers</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="MichalisKamburelis">MichalisKamburelis</a> answer: Patches for ampersand operator
are welcome :) — it should be easy by modifying only PasDoc_Tokenizer
sources.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Additional special tags and more</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;m using a wide range of several documents processors
(JavaDoc, CppDoc, Doxygen ect.) for
different languages. One common thing uniting these programs is their
ability to describe more informations about the document, its
relationship to the whole API ect. To make it short: I&#8217;m missing special
tags like @version and @since. Both tags are commonly in use and should
be introduced to <a href="index">PasDoc</a>. It&#8217;s very hard to find out when
a unit ect. had been introduced to the API or had been changed in depth
without such tags. Such informations including @author should appear at
the top of the page and not at the bottom.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comment grouping<br>
Would it be possible to set a command line option for
<a href="index">PasDoc</a> to group related identifiers that are documented
by one comment:</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My main reasoning is that each procedure does not necessarily require
individual documentation and it would be helpful if one comment caused
them to be grouped together in the HTML output. Just a thought.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="MichalisKamburelis">MichalisKamburelis</a>: I fully agree and I plan to do this by @groupBegin, @groupEnd tags. See
the preliminary ideas on my homepage: <a href="MichalisKamburelis">MichalisKamburelis</a> .
I don&#8217;t think that we can do it without any @-tags (like your
example), because this would tend to group too many things.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I [<a href="DoDi">DoDi</a>] agree2, and suggest a more flexible system for
grouping and nesting related items together. It should extend the
currently fixed item classification, in e.g. classes with
fields/methods/properties, or units with constants/variables/procedures.
Every "container" (unit, CIO, enum) should have one complete list of all
members (for link resolution), and any number of sub-lists, which can be
built by the parser, "linker", or by the generators, based on tags or
kind of scripts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I think that an empty line can be assumed as the end of grouped of
identifiers to avoid implementing a any new tag. This is a common way of
groupping related/overrided identifiers. Also if a comment precedes a
block (for example const or var) it is related to all elements in the
group.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>"support to format multiple return values"<br>
It would be really nice if @returns(&#8230;&#8203;) could output return codes and
descriptions in a more structured way - like the @params tag already
does. Most intuivie way would be to allow more @returns tags for a
single method, i.e. @returns(S_OK if successful) and @returns(E_FAIL if
an error occured). S_OK and E_FAIL should be formated as 'label' of the
return code and all following words are the description.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="MichalisKamburelis">MichalisKamburelis</a>: Seems like a good idea. But for backward compatibility, new tag should
be named different, like @returnsValue. Old @returns with old behavior
should stay.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>No problem, when the Result is treated like a parameter or any other
(local) variable. The parser can provide all required (type)
information, that only must be evaluated appropriately by the
generators.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="WantedFeaturesDocBook">WantedFeaturesDocBook</a> output</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>use a Delphi project (.dpr) file
as input and process all files listed there</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Delphi IDE-Plugin to build documentation for the current editor window
on the fly and display it (should work great using the caching
algorithm)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Delphi IDE-Plugin to show the documentation of a unit on a
separate tab page of the editor window with clickable links to the
actual implementation. (Yes, I am dreaming ;-) )</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>optionally calculate correct line numbers and put those into the output</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>make caching work properly by putting the unit file&#8217;s timestamp into
the cache file and comparing it with the current on-disk timestamp. This
should also expire any units that use this unit (which will
automatically reparse descendent classes of classes in this unit that
are defined in other units).</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>implemented half of this (expires
units, but not units that need the expired unit)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>implementing
re-parsing is harder than it appears because units are not parsed in
dependency order</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>ship files with defines from Delphi, Kylix and FPC
(maybe even GPC) for different platforms.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If someone wrote his source code, then he already <em>knows</em> about the
defines that he used (and that may be relevant to pass to pasdoc). In
other words: It&#8217;s a job of compiler writers to document what symbols are
automatically defined by their compilers. After a programmer already
wrote a source code using such-and-such compiler defines, this
programmer already knows about these defines&#8230;&#8203; So these files would
only be useful as a comfortable daya
for people too lazy to grep their own sources for $ifdef :) On the
practical side: making such files complete is almost impossible, because
each compiler/compiler mode/OS/processor/etc. results in a different set
of defines, and it&#8217;s tiresome to document them all (and maintain such
documentation to keep it up-to-date with new compiler versions!). That
said: if someone really wants to take a shot at preparing such files, go
on, you are welcome to add them to this wiki. If you will do it well, we
will include them in pasdoc. –
<a href="MichalisKamburelis">MichalisKamburelis</a></p>

</li>
<li>
<p>ability to deal with files that have the same name but are in
different directories. How does one distinguish those without having
search paths?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ability to link external documentation that was created
by <a href="index">PasDoc</a> (some mapping file class/function &#8594; html file
must exist for this)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Generating Labels and URL in Graphviz files to link images classes
files in HTML (or HTML Help).
<a href="http://home.so-net.net.tw/oodtsen/wingraphviz/index.htm">Look How to do in Clinet-side image map</a>. With this feature, it&#8217;s possible to navigate
in units/classes doc from graph! –<a href="GarfieldFr">GarfieldFr</a></p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I started doing this, now in GVClasses.dot and GVUses.dot graph nodes
have proper href= attribute. So we can process them with</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>dot -Tcmapx GVUses.dot dot -Tcmapx GVClasses.dot</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now we have to use output of above calls from dot inside HTML files,
like GVClasses.html and GVUses.html, and we will have client-side image
maps assigned to graphviz images. This would require automatically
calling dot program – this indeed should be done, I&#8217;ll have to
investigate how to implement it nicely, so that pasdoc will not fail if
dot can&#8217;t be executed. This should also remove some mess with four
<a href="CommandLine">CommandLine</a> required to use graphviz – only two
<a href="CommandLine">CommandLine</a> options shoud be needed for this. Also,
you can process files to svg format, then you will have links included
directly in svg file, and then we don&#8217;t have to make client-side maps in
HTML at all. Unfortunately, I don&#8217;t know of any WWW browser that fully
supports svg (allowing user to follow URLs from nodes) at this time&#8230;&#8203;
But pasdoc should not lose the possibility of using svg instead of some
pixel-based format of images. –

<p>It would be nice to have an Include directive able to include ASCI
text, images or html in a point of a code comment. It would be very nice
if this include directive also could build the name of the file to
include by some kind of rule to the name of the class (include
ModelMaker exported diagrams).</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="MichalisKamburelis">MichalisKamburelis</a>: For me, this splits to a couple of sensible requests:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Done</em> I think that for including images, we should create new
pasdoc tag, like @image(filename).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Done</em> For including text at the
point of description, it could be useful to create a tag like
@include(filename). Given file would be always interpreted as being
written using normal pasdoc descriptions syntax (@-tags are interpreted,
empty line means a paragraph, user can always use @html / @latex tags to
force direct markup etc. – just like
<a href="IntroductionAndConclusion">IntroductionAndConclusion</a> content).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then we can allow user to use @classname, @name and similar tags as
part of filename. E.g. @include(@classname.txt) before a class TStream
would be equivalent to @include(TStream.txt).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Block "exclude tag" which allow exclude block of variables, constants,
procedures from documentation. In some case is hard to write @exclude
many time. I thing that tag as "@exclude_start" &#8230;&#8203; &#8230;&#8203; &#8230;&#8203;
"@exclude_end" will be useful.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Seems fine for me. Although I think that names should be @excludebegin
and @excludeend (because begin/end pair is familiar to Pascal
programmers, and we shouldn&#8217;t use _ in the middle of the tag because 1.
currently we don&#8217;t allow _ in the middle of tag, so e.g. @name_some
works 2. we have @classname instead of @class_name 3. in general Pascal
programmers don&#8217;t use _, they rather use <a href="CamelCase">CamelCase</a>,
so people would be more comfortable to write @excludeBegin and
@excludeEnd than @exclude_begin and @exclude_end). –
<a href="MichalisKamburelis">MichalisKamburelis</a></p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow tag expansion in another tag. For expamle: Parent for this class
is @link(@inherited)<br></p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that this is already done in many cases, i.e. tags are expanded
within other tags, e.g. you can use other @-tags inside tags @code,
@raises, @returns, @bold, @italic, @abstract&#8230;&#8203; However it&#8217;s indeed not
done for @link tag yet. That&#8217;s because current expansion of @inherited
and @name and such wouldn&#8217;t be suitable for @link tag (because
@inherited and @name add some presentational tags around returned name).
As for your example, @link(@inherited) is not needed, you can already
write just @inherited, this already produces a linked name. But indeed
writing things like @link(@inherited.<a href="MethodName">MethodName</a>)
would be a nice feature to have. So I agree with this request, this
should be made possible. Moreover, some request above (see @image and
@include tag) also could use of this feature. –

<p>One item which would add a lot of value to <a href="index">PasDoc</a>
would be to include a means of documenting the functions/procedures that
can be called on a particular class. atm, <a href="index">PasDoc</a> will
list all functions/procedures that a particular class <em>introduces</em> - but
there&#8217;s no way of finding out what it&#8217;s really capable of. For example,
if you have:</p>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="pygments highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8;"><code data-lang="pascal"><span></span><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">type</span>
  TClassOne <span style="color: #666666">=</span> <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">class</span>(TComponent)
  <span style="color: #008000">public</span>
    <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">function</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">MethodBase</span>()<span style="color: #666666">:</span> <span style="color: #B00040">integer</span><span style="color: #666666">;</span>
  <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">end</span><span style="color: #666666">;</span>

  TClassTwo <span style="color: #666666">=</span> <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">class</span>(TClassOne)
  <span style="color: #008000">public</span>
    <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">function</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">MethodSubclass</span>()<span style="color: #666666">:</span> <span style="color: #B00040">integer</span><span style="color: #666666">;</span>
  <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">end</span><span style="color: #666666">;</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The page for TClassTwo will list
"<a href="MethodSubclass">MethodSubclass</a>", but give no indication that
"<a href="MethodBase">MethodBase</a>" can also be called on this subclass.
This makes working with <a href="index">PasDoc</a>'s output a lot more
difficult than it needs to be; in order to find out what methods you can
call on a particular class involves looking at the documentation for
that class, then the parent class, then that parent&#8217;s class&#8230;&#8203; It would
be <em>extremely</em> useful if a layout similar to that which Delphi&#8217;s help
file offers would be implemented as an option, which would give an
at-a-glace view of what any given class offers.</p>
