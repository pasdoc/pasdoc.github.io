:doctitle: --no-macro command-line option

link:CommandLine[CommandLine] option --no-macro tells pasdoc to _not_
handle macros. In link:PasDocGui[PasDocGui] you can uncheck the box
__Recognize FPC macros syntax when parsing__.

Macros are supported by FPC and look like

[source,pascal]
----
{$define MY_CONST := 3 + 1}
const Four = MY_CONST;
----

By default, macro support is _turned on_ in pasdoc. Even if you don't
use FPC macros in your sources, there's extremely small chance that you
will ever need to use this option to turn macro support off. You really
need to turn macro support off only if you write some strange things
like

[source,pascal]
----
{$define MY_CONST := 3 + 1}
----

and you _expect that your compiler (Delphi, FPC) will_ _ignore_ __the
"__:= 3 + 1_" part_ (and treat the directive as equivalent to simple
`{$define MY_CONST}` ).
