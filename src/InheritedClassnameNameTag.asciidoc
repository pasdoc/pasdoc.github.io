Use the tag @name to insert the name of the current item.

The following three tags may be used only within a class, i.e. when
current item is either a class or a member of some class. (__Class__
means a real class or an interface, a record etc.)

* @classname inserts the name of current class.
* @inheritedClass inserts the name of ancestor class.

* @inherited: If current item is a class, this is the same thing as
@inheritedClass: it inserts the name of ancestor class. If current item
is a class member (i.e. a field, a property or a method) then it inserts
a qualified name of this member in ancestor class (this is handy if you
want to link from an overriden method description to ancestor method
description).

@inherited and @inheritedClass also create a link to appropriate item.

Example:

[source,pascal]
----
{ @name is a method of @classname which overrides the method
  @inherited to do something completely different... }
----
