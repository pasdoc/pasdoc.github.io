:doctitle: --auto-back-comments command-line option

Use `--auto-back-comments` to automatically assign a `//` comment to the preceding identifier on the same line.

For example this will be parsed in a correct way if you call pasdoc with `--auto-back-comments`:

```pascal
var
  Foo: Integer; // Documentation of Foo
  Bar: Integer; // Documentation of Bar
  Xyz: Integer;
```

Without the `--auto-back-comments`, PasDoc follows the rule documented at link:WhereToPlaceComments[Where To Place Comments], which admittedly results in un-intuitive behavior for the above example: a comment is by default assigned to the *following* (not *preceding*) identifier, so `Documentation of Foo` would be used for `Bar`. You have to mark the comment with additional `<` character to make it work without the `--auto-back-comments` option:

```pascal
var
  Foo: Integer; //< Documentation of Foo
  Bar: Integer; //< Documentation of Bar
  Xyz: Integer;
```
