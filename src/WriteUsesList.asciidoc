:doctitle: --write-uses-list command-line option

link:index[PasDoc] can optionally include the list of units in a
unit's uses clause to that unit's description. Pass the
--write-uses-list directive on the link:CommandLine[CommandLine] to
enable this feature.

Example:

----
pasdoc --write-uses-list ...
----

If a unit in the uses list is part of the documentation, it is clickable
in the output.
