:doctitle: Development Snapshots

Try the current development version of link:index[PasDoc] by downloading snapshot from here:

https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/releases/tag/snapshot

The files available there are automatically build from the latest source (using https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/tree/master/.github/workflows[GitHub Actions]).

In particular, download latest builds for:

* https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/releases/download/snapshot/pasdoc-0.17.0.snapshot-linux-x86_64.tar.gz[Linux (x86_64)]
* https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/releases/download/snapshot/pasdoc-0.17.0.snapshot-linux-arm.tar.gz[Linux (Arm, 32-bit) (Raspberry Pi)]
* https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/releases/download/snapshot/pasdoc-0.17.0.snapshot-linux-aarch64.tar.gz[Linux (Aarch64, 64-bit) (Raspberry Pi, PineTab2)]
* https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/releases/download/snapshot/pasdoc-0.17.0.snapshot-win64.zip[Windows (x86_64)]
* https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/releases/download/snapshot/pasdoc-0.17.0.snapshot-darwin-x86_64.zip[macOS (x86_64)]
* https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/releases/download/snapshot/pasdoc-0.17.0.snapshot-darwin-x86_64.zip[macOS (Aarch64)]

These snapshots look like regular link:index[PasDoc] releases, but are actually compiled automatically from https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc[current GitHub code].

Note: Since these "snapshot" versions change frequently, when reporting bugs please mention not only the version number (`0.17.0.snapshot`) but also the date when you downloaded them or https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc[last GIT commit hash] used to build them.

Note: You can always download and compile current pasdoc sources
yourself. See the GIT instructions link:index[on the main page] and
see link:CompilingPasDoc[CompilingPasDoc].
