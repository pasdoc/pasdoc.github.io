:doctitle: @note and @warning tags

The `@note` and `@warning` tags allow to display a nicely formatted box with a note (something of particular interest to the reader) or a warning.

Their content can be anything, other @-tags inside are expanded too. For example this works:

```pascal
{
  @note(Please open your eyes while reading)
  @note(Please check @link(Create) for more details)
  @note(For more infos see @url(https://example.com/))

  @warning(test)
  @warning(hello @italic(world)!)
  @warning(Does this work? - @bold(Yes.))
}
```
