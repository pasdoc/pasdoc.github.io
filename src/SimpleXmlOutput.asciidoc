:doctitle: SimpleXML output

Using link:CommandLine[CommandLine] option `--format simplexml` makes pasdoc output
a simple XML document for each unit.

The XML contains the parsed code tree,
and the descriptions (with @-tags replaced with some XML elements formatting).
This allows you to easily write other programs that process these
XML documents and do.. well, anything you want. Like convert it for your CMS or wiki.
