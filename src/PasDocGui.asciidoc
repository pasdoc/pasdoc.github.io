:doctitle: Using PasDoc GUI

`pasdoc_gui` is a GUI interface to the whole link:index[PasDoc]
functionality. You can find it inside pasdoc releases in the bin/
subdirectory, along the traditional command-line pasdoc utility.

The way to work with pasdoc_gui is simple:

1. Set the options as you wish. First of all, add the source files to
process on the "Source Files" tab.
2. Save your options as "pasdoc settings" (*.pds) file, this will allow you to load them back later. 3.
Generate documentation by the big fat "Generate" button, or menu item
(shortcut F9). For link:HtmlOutput[HtmlOutput], we will automatically
run WWW browser to view newly made documentation.

You can always press F1 when you work with pasdoc_gui, this will open
your configured WWW browser with help appropriate for currently focused
control.
