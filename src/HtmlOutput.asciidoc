Command-line option --format html (or -O html in short) makes pasdoc
write HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) output. HTML files are usually
viewed using web browsers, available on all modern computer systems.

It is the default output file format. Several files will be created for
this output type, one for each unit, class, interface and object,
additionally some overview files with lists of all constants, types etc.

This is the preferred output for online viewing.

Some details about HTML output:

## [[css]] CSS

The look of HTML output is controlled by CSS code in pasdoc.css file,
generated by pasdoc while making HTML output. You can customize how your
documentation looks by modifying this file. See
http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/[W3C resources about CSS]. See also
link:PasDocCssExamples[example alternative CSS styles for pasdoc]
that you can use.

## [[html-standard-conformance]] HTML standard conformance

Html output produced by pasdoc is completely valid HTML 4.01
Transitional format. See http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/[W3C HTML 4.01 Specification].

You can validate it using any html validator. In case you never used
html validator:

* http://validator.w3.org/[W3C online validator] is handy if you don't
want the trouble of installing anything on your computer.
* There's also excellent standalone validator nsgmls. It's part of the
http://www.jclark.com/sp/[SP suite]. Debian users should be able to
install it simply by installing package named sp.
* A fork of SP suite
is developed by project http://openjade.sourceforge.net/[OpenJade].
It's named OpenSP. nsgmls is renamed inside this suite to onsgmls.
Debian users should be able to install it simply by installing package
named opensp. Windows users should be able to install it as a
http://www.cygwin.com[cygwin] package OpenSP.
+
onsgmls is used by
pasdoc's automatic tests (inside tests/ subdirectory), so this is
somewhat a "validator of choice" for us.
* Emacs users can also use
validator included in Emacs html mode (M-x sgml-next-trouble-spot,
standard shortcut is C-c C-o).
* Of course, this list doesn't try to be
exhaustive. There are many more html validators out there.
