## [[parsing-implementation-section]] Parsing implementation section

Currently, link:Home[PasDoc] only parses the interface section of a
unit. Only the identifiers found in the interface section are
documented, using only the comments in the interface section. For some
people, this is OK, as the interface seems a right place to document
things --- but it's definitely a matter of taste.

Many people would like to parse also the implementation section of a
unit, and get comments from there:

* To document things visible in the interface by the comments from the
implementation section. This is useful if you want to keep the interface
section short, and you simply prefer to put (long) comments in the
implementation section.
* Or to document __everything__, not only things
visible in the interface. This is useful if you want a documentation of
unit internals. Closely related to this is the idea to parse a program
file (which is very similar to the unit implementation).

This is a common link:Home[PasDoc] feature request (e.g.
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1189121&group_id=4213&atid=354213[RFE 1189121, JavaDoc-like Tag handling],
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=976519&group_id=4213&atid=354213[RFE 976519, 4 question...]). And we very much would like to have the option
to parse implementation section! However, as far as we know, noone is
actively working on it. **We are waiting for YOUR patches!**:) Please
grab the latest link:Home[PasDoc] sources from GitHub
https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/ and submit patches or pull
requests implementing it.

Implementing this is a matter of:

* Adding to parser (PasDoc_Parser.pas) ability to parse implementation
sections of units/programs. The parser needs not be a real parser -- it
can cheat by simply skipping some things without really understanding
them (e.g. if you find a token begin then parser can simply consume
tokens up to a matching end, without paying any attention to what it
reads). So, keep hacking PasDoc_Parser.pas until it can parse the
implementation section of your units.
* This cannot break existing
pasdoc working, so this feature should be only activated by a
command-line option, like --parse-implementation. You can add two
versions: --parse-implementation=only-for-interface and
--parse-implementation=all, it looks like both approaches have their
needs.
* Decide how to merge documentation between
interface/implementation (comments from the interface override comments
from the implementation? The other way around? Maybe they should be
glued together?)
