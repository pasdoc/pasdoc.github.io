<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Stating it differently, which way is better:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><em>Mix the comments with the sources</em>, like javadoc,
ocamldoc, pasdoc and many others do. You put comments inside source
files, before each declared item, and then documentation generator
parses source files and extracts those comments into documentation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Separate the comments from the sources</em>, like fpdoc does. You put
comments inside a separate XML file.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Below are some of my thoughs about this. If you don&#8217;t have time to read
this, here&#8217;s my conclusion: I really don&#8217;t think that one way or the
other is ultimately better. I prefer the "mix the comments with the
sources" way, but I would be absolutely happy also using a documentation
generator with an approach "separate the comments from the sources".
Well, actually I did, I used and tested fpdoc a little, and I like it
very much. No doubt, pasdoc can learn a few things from fpdoc (actually,
some of the features I done in pasdoc were inspired by fpdoc behavior).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A common argument against "mix with sources" approach is that when the
documentation gets larger, it tends to clutter unit&#8217;s interface. I don&#8217;t
think that this is a real problem because:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>First of all, I don&#8217;t think about that as a clutter. Units interface
specification without any documentation is good for compilers, not for
humans. It&#8217;s <em>especially</em> important for new people, that read your
source code for the 1st time. Documentation makes unit&#8217;s source larger,
but it&#8217;s just an essential part of a unit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That said, it&#8217;s sometimes
useful for someone to get a "higher-level" view of the way unit&#8217;s
interface is written. The solution is: look at documentation generated
by pasdoc. pasdoc <a href="HtmlOutput">HtmlOutput</a> presents a nice summary
view of each unit and of each class. This summary is clear, compact and
uncluttered. Moreover, output of pasdoc presents some other summary
views, that are not available when looking at the unit&#8217;s source:
"all-items" pages (e.g. "all identifiers" page, "all classes", etc.),
class hierarchy diagram and even some graphviz graphs with class
hierarchy and unit dependency. So if you really prefer to just forget
about all this documentation strings for now and just see the list of
declared identifiers, then look at documentation generated by pasdoc.
BTW, The same is true for fpdoc. Both pasdoc and fpdoc (and any other
doc generator for other language) present in final documentation both a
nice summary and a nice detailed descriptions for documented units. The
difference between fpdoc and pasdoc comes when you look at units source
code: if pasdoc was used, the unit&#8217;s source code is cluttered with
comments. If fpdoc was used, the unit&#8217;s source is compact and not
cluttered, but you don&#8217;t immediately see documentation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Conclusion: for programmers already familiar with the unit source, it
doesn&#8217;t matter. They are familiar with unit source, and even an
interface largely mixed with a large comments looks "clear and compact"
for them. I know that this is the case for me and many of my units. For
programmers new to the unit source: "separate from sources" approach
looks better, more compact, but is without documentation. So is it
really useful ? Ultimately, the answer remains "both approaches, <em>mix
with sources</em> and <em>separate from sources</em>, are equally good". In each
approach, the generated output provides all the advantages: you can see
both a compact summary and a large detailed descriptions there.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some additional arguments:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>In "mix with sources" approach, descriptions are "naturally" linked to
the appropriate item. In "separate with sources" they are not. E.g. in
fpdoc&#8217;s XML format you have to specify &lt;element name="ItemName"&gt; for
each item ItemName. This means that you must specify the name of your
identifier at least twice: in units interface source and in
documentation. Program makeskel exists to generate a skeleton with all
such &lt;element&#8230;&#8203;&gt; tags, so it&#8217;s not that hard. However, in "mix with
sources" you don&#8217;t need such program like makeskel at all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IMO [<a href="DoDi">DoDi</a>] <em>external files</em> are great for producing book-style
documentation, with overviews, specifications and further background
information, which should not clutter the source code. Such information
also may be presented to the <em>users</em> in various (natural) languages. *
Also the interface part of the units should stay readable, not cluttered
by comments that possibly are outdated or became otherwise obsolete, in
the actual implementation. In the interface section a <em>one-line
abstract</em> should be sufficient for every item. The <em>developer</em> can find
more detailed information with the implementation of a procedure or
method, where it can be kept better in sync with the actual
implementation. We definitely deserve an merge of descriptions, from
different sources/places.</p>

<p>Some larger things that I want to implement in pasdoc. No, I&#8217;m not

<p>This has two purposes:</p>

<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>To be a demo of a simple output generator, potentially useful to
anyone else who would like to write new output generator and would like
to see how it can be done (existing html and latex generators are not
good examples of "simple generators").</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And as a side-effect, we will
use it to generate plain-text data that is easier to search by tipue.
For now you can&#8217;t search using tipue for special characters that are
escaped in html using &amp;-references. Search engine will just not see
these characters correctly. Also, when you search for a word like class
search engine incorrectly finds items with code like &lt;tag class="&#8230;&#8203;"&gt;,
i.e. it finds word class inside html tag. This will be fixed by
converting RawDescription to plain text. Short description placed in
index entry will be as AbstractDescription in plain text, long
description will be DetailedDescription + Params + etc. also in plain
text.</p>

<p>Output to fpdoc input format. Text below will be moved to
<a href="FpdocOutput">FpdocOutput</a> page when this will be implemented.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Free Pascal code documenter, fpdoc, is a program distributed and
developed as part of <a href="http://www.freepascal.org/">FreePascal</a>. It&#8217;s
goal is similar to pasdoc: parse Pascal units and generate documentation
for them. But, unlike pasdoc, fpdoc does not read descriptions of items
from the comments placed in unit&#8217;s source file. Instead you put your
descriptions in a separate XML file. fpdoc reads both the unit&#8217;s source
file and the XML file with descriptions and generates documentation from
them. See <a href="http://www.freepascal.org/docs-html/fpdoc/fpdoc.html">fpdoc reference manual online</a> for more information.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you tell pasdoc to use fpdoc output then pasdoc will write
documentation in fpdoc&#8217;s XML format. This means that after running
pasdoc, you get a file docs.xml (unless you changed "docs" to something
else using <a href="NameOption">--name option</a>). Then you can run fpdoc,
telling fpdoc to again parse the same unit source files and additionally
to take generated docs.xml file. And then you get documentation
generated by fpdoc.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Why this is useful ?</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>This means that you can use fpdoc generated output, while at the same
time writing descriptions inside Pascal source file using pasdoc&#8217;s
@tags. I&#8217;m not going to tell you whether the documentation generated
directly (e.g. to html or latex) by pasdoc is better or worse than the
one generated by fpdoc – the purpose of this pasdoc&#8217;s output format is
to allow you to check this out yourself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remember that things that
pasdoc and fpdoc allow in their descriptions are similar but not exactly
the same, so if you&#8217;re committed to using only fpdoc&#8217;s output, than
you&#8217;re probably better off switching to writing your descriptions
directly in fpdoc&#8217;s XML format, instead of using pasdoc to make XML
files for fpdoc. And this is the second possible use of this: if you
have a large documentation set written in pasdoc-style (with
descriptions embedded in units' source files, with pasdoc&#8217;s @-tags) and
you want to switch for whatever reason to fpdoc, then you can do it:
just run pasdoc once with output format set to fpdoc and you&#8217;ll get all
your documentation converted to fpdoc. Of course, remember that the page
you&#8217;re reading right now is part of pasdoc&#8217;s documentation. This means
that people who wrote it may consider pasdoc better than fpdoc :) This
is something about your freedom: we are so generous that we even let you
to easily switch from pasdoc to other documentation generator program
:) Seriously: I don&#8217;t think that pasdoc is ultimately better (or
worse) than fpdoc, and this output format allows you to combine some of
pasdoc&#8217;s and fpdoc&#8217;s strengths.</p>

<h3 id="_-support-for-groups-of-items"><a id="support-for-groups-of-items"></a> Support for groups of items</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Group of items are items that share a common documentation string.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The idea is that you write one documentation string for a group of
items. In generated documentation, this group of items is documented as
one item, e.g.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>=== procedure BlahBlah1; ===

Normal doc string for procedure BlahBlah1.

=== procedure Foo and
    procedure Bar and
    procedure Xyz ===

One doc string that describes at once three procedures Foo, Bar and Xyz.

=== procedure BlahBlah2 ===

Normal doc string for procedure BlahBlah2.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So the idea is that the items in one group not only share the same
documentation string, but also that user reading this documentation
clearly sees that these three items are documented in <em>one</em> place by
<em>one</em> doc string. In other words: no, this can&#8217;t be implemented by
simply copying the same doc string to a couple of items. This must be
clear and readable, so that user reading documentation can immediately
see that some items are grouped. So this will require special support in
each doc final format.</p>

expect or allow for appropriate tables or pages. Some general redesign
should be done, which allows for an integration of all the wanted
features in an extended model of <em>grouping and nesting</em> declarations and
descriptions. ** For enumerated type values, only consecutive values of
the same enumerated type are allowed. So, practically, always use

<p>Of course, it is not mandatory, not even desirable, to divide every unit
you document into sections. This feature has it&#8217;s best use when you have
a large unit with many global procedures/functions – then by using
sections you can nicely indicate to reader that routines in this unit
can be logically divided into separate sections, like</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>"routines that deal with strings",</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"routines that deal with filenames",</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"routines that deal with something-else".</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that sections and groups (proposed in the previous point) somewhat
complement each other.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Groups allow you to easily group together things that are very closely
related, so closely that they are documented by one documentation
string. Groups make it both easier to write documentation, and easier to
reader to see that these things are documented at once.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sections allow
you to group more things together, that are somewhat loosely related, so
they all deserve a common description, but also every item inside
section has it&#8217;s own specific documentation.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>In summary, this feature is like splitting a large unit to many
"sub-units" in documentation.</p>

<h3 id="_-more-wiki-like-syntax-for-pasdoc-descriptions"><a id="more-wiki-like-syntax-for-pasdoc-descriptions"></a> More wiki-like syntax for pasdoc descriptions</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Wiki-like syntax means that you can achieve some (formatting) effect
without using any @-tag. Some existing features of pasdoc descriptions
are already wiki-like syntax (see
<a href="WritingDocumentation">WritingDocumentation</a>):</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Empty line creates a paragraph</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dashes rules (--- creates m-dash,&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;creates n-dash)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Automatic recognizing of URLs</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>More wiki-like features are planned. The following things should be
achievable with wiki-like syntax:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>marking text italic/bold (equivalent to @bold and @italic tags)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>marking text as simple code (@code tag)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>making lists (@orderedList, @unorderedList, @definitionList, @item,
@itemLabel; preferably some auto-detection of @itemSpacing should also
be done here)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>making tables (@table, @row, @cell; preferably also
@rowHead)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Notes:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Wiki-like syntax should be carefully chosen. Wiki-like syntax adds
additional meanings to some simple constructions, so if we design
wiki-like rules badly, people will too often <em>accidentaly</em> do something.
At the same time, wiki-like syntax must look simple and readable in
source code, use short sequences of characters to mark things (otherwise
there will be no benefit of using wiki-like syntax over traditional
@-tags approach). Negative example of bad wiki-like syntax is LaTeX.
There are many special rules and exceptions in LaTeX syntax, and often
they are things that are very seldom used in practice. This means that
LaTeX writers can easily activate some special feature by accident, and
this is bad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Introducing wiki-like syntax would break pasdoc
compatibility badly. So it will have to be actvated by --wiki-syntax.
Alternatively, if many people will support this decision, we can make
wiki-like syntax active by default and provide a way to turn if off by
--no-wiki-syntax. Wiki-like syntax is always just a shortcut for
equivalent functionality of @-tags, so if someone prefers to not use
wiki-like syntax, it&#8217;s OK.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Note that we can&#8217;t directly borrow ideas
from some wiki engines (like moinmoin). That&#8217;s because wiki engines
usually say that line-break creates a new paragraph. This means that
wiki pages usually have very long lines. That&#8217;s not a problem for wiki
engines, because edit boxes in WWW browsers will wrap text, and if
someone uses external editor then it&#8217;s easy to explain to him <em>please
don&#8217;t introduce line-breaks without a purpose of creating new
paragraph</em>. But pasdoc can&#8217;t treat line-break as a new paragraph.
Pasdoc must treat line-break just as some whitespace. That&#8217;s because
pasdoc descriptions are used within Pascal source files, and people
don&#8217;t like to have long lines in source files, and are often
uncomfortable with viewing source files that have too long lines. This
may seem like a small thing, but actually this means that many other
rules of wiki engines must be different than pasdoc wiki-like syntax.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Note that we can&#8217;t diectly borrow ideas from
<a href="http://www.maplefish.com/todd/aft.html">aft</a> because aft uses tab
character to mark various things. But people are often uncomfortable
with using tab characters in Pascal source files. So for pasdoc, tab
character must always mean "just some whitespace".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="AutoLinkOption">Auto-linking</a> may be treated as some form of
wiki-like syntax (shortcut for @link). But it is activated by different
command-line option, --auto-link, and can be locally deactivated by
@noLink tag.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Programs that we could borrow some ideas from:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://asciidoctor.org/">AsciiDoctor</a>. A standalone text formatter, with a precise syntax (unlike Markdown "flavours") and a rich feature set.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://txt2tags.sourceforge.net/">txt2tags</a>. A nice standalone text formatter. Better than aft because it doesn&#8217;t make problems when you don&#8217;t write in ISO-8859-1 character set (but e.g. in ISO-8859-2 set that includes Polish chars).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.lrde.epita.fr/people/theo/html/ocaml_ref/manual029.html">ocamldoc</a>. pasdoc equivalent for ocaml. ocamldoc has some nice bits of wiki-like syntax for some things, e.g. for lists.</p>
