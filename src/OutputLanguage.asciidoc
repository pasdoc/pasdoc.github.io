## [[notes-about-encoding]] Notes about encoding

Some languages have several possible encodings. Although the translated
strings should be the same, but it is important that you choose the same
encoding that you use inside your source code (inside your documentation
comments). That is because link:Home[PasDoc] doesn't convert the
encoding of your comments, we simply put your comments inside HTML (or
other outputs), of course after processing of the @-tags. So it's your
responsibility to use in your source code the same encoding that you
indicate by the --language option.

Note that the encodings listed above apply to the link:Home[PasDoc]
version compiled without STRING_UNICODE. This means that
link:Home[PasDoc] was compiled with FPC or with non-Unicode Delphi.
In particular, the officially released link:Home[PasDoc] versions
are compiled with FPC, so the encodings listed above are correct.

If you compile link:Home[PasDoc] yourself, with newer (Unicode)
Delphi, then an alternative version will be used, where all languages
are encoded in UTF-8.
