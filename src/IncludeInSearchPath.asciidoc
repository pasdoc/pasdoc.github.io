:doctitle: --include command-line option

Just like a Pascal compiler, link:index[PasDoc] understands $include
compiler directive and reads include files. It searches for include
files in the current directory and in all directories given with the
--include link:CommandLine[CommandLine] option. Examples:

----
pasdoc --include c:\mysources\include --include c:\3rdparty\somelib\include ...

pasdoc --include c:\mysources\include;c:\3rdparty\somelib\include ...
----

As shown in the first example it is possible to specify multiple `--include` options.

You can also specify multiple include paths per --include directive,
separating them with the platform's path separator (which is ':' on Unix
and ';' on Windows) as shown in the second example. So both examples
above (and the two below) are equivalent.

Another example when running under Unix:

----
pasdoc --include /home/me/include --include /usr/local/pascal/include ...

pasdoc --include /home/me/include:/usr/local/pascal/include ...
----

The short form of `--include` option is `-I` (upper case i).
