:doctitle: Wanted Feature: Delete First Char of Each Line in Comment Block

The goal of this link:WantedFeatures[WantedFeatures] is to have a
look better comment block in source code. I use this feature in
http://phpdoc.org[PHPDoc]. This is not a very important feature.

See a sample:

[source,pascal]
----
{**
*  This unit do something. Yes! realy!!
*}
----

with this comment, the decription will be:

----
* This unit do something. Yes! realy!! *
----

With the feature, the '*' at begining and end of lines will be skiped
and the result will be

----
This unit do something. Yes! realy!!
----

Another sample

[source,pascal]
----
{************************
* This unit do something. Yes! realy!!
**************************}
----

Here, the result will be

----
This unit do something. Yes! realy!!
----
