## [[parser-improvements]] Parser improvements

Some things that must be improved in pasdoc parser (PasDoc_Parser.pas), to make it better understand the source code it's reading:

* `ParseProperty`: Parser must be able to understand where are property read and write specifiers names, to avoid including private specifier names in documentation (see Michalis' mail on http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/pasdoc-main[mailing list] "Full declaration of properties is shown" on 2005-05-29)
* `ParseFieldsVariables` and `ParseRecordCase`: Parser must be improved to better understand record fields in records "case clauses" and to understand "records in records", to close pasdoc bug 1199354 completely.
